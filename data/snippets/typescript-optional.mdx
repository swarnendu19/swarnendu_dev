When developing a TypeScript project, defining types and interfaces is a basic and important task. However, we often encounter such scenarios:

For some data object attributes, not all fields need to be passed. This leads to a common type annotation problem.

Suppose we have an interface that represents a user:

```typescript
interface User {
  username: string
  email: string
  phone: string
  address: string
  age: number
}
```

When creating a user, you may not need all attributes to be created. We generally need to define a separate interface for this case:

```typescript
interface CreateUserOptions {
  username: string
  email: string
  phone?: string
  address?: string
  age?: number
}

function createUser(options: CreateUserOptions): User {
  // TODO
}
```

It is obvious that there is a relationship between the two types, so I hope that the `CreateUserOptions` type can be automatically generated according to the `Article` type. Some properties in `CreateUserOptions` are optional.

But unfortunately Typescript does not provide such syntax, so we have to implement this function manually.

```typescript
type Optional<T, K extends keyof T> = Omit<T, K> & Partial<Pick<T, K>>
```

So we can use it like this:

```typescript
type CreateUserOptions = Optional<Article, 'author' | 'date' | 'readCount'>
```

Explain the principle of this type:

- `Omit<T, K>`: exclude the `K` property from `T`.

  ```typescript
  Omit<UserProfile, 'phone' | 'address' | 'age'>
  // Result: { username: string; email: string; }
  ```

- `Pick<T, K>`: Pick `K` attributes from `T`.

  ```typescript
  Pick<UserProfile, 'phone' | 'address' | 'age'>
  // Result: { phone: string; address: string; age: number; }
  ```

- `Partial<T>`: Make all properties in `T` optional.

  ```typescript
  Partial<Pick<UserProfile, 'phone' | 'address' | 'age'>>
  // Result: { phone?: string; address?: string; age?: number; }
  ```

- Type merging: Use the intersection type `&` to merge `Omit<T, K>` and `Partial<Pick<T, K>>` to form the final Result:

  ```typescript
  type CreateUserOptions = Optional<User, 'phone' | 'address' | 'age'>
  ```
