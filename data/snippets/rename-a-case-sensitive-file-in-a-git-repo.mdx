Simple file/directory renaming in git is not a problem.
But what if you want to rename a case sensitive file/directory in your git repo?
For example, you have a file named `README.md` and you want to rename it to `Readme.md`.

Keep in mind that renaming by **IDE** or **file manager** will not work because git will not recognize the change. <Twemoji emoji="face-with-monocle" />

You can do it with the following command:

```bash
git mv README.md Readme.md
```

Then follow with the usual git workflow:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Rename README.md to Readme.md"
```

That's it! You have successfully renamed a case sensitive file/directory in a git repo.

Happy commiting! <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />
