## Hi there <Twemoji emoji="waving-hand" />

I'm **Swarnendu**, a software engineer from **Kolkata, India**. I have a passion for all things **Javascript**, and I enjoy building web applications. I work mainly with **Typescript**, **Vue**, **React**, **NodeJS**, and **TailwindCSS**.

I started this blog as a way to document and share stuff I have learned and found useful as a software engineer. Building and writing things down is a great way for me to solidify my understanding of new concepts and ideas. I hope my blog could be a helpful resource for fellow devs who interested in web dev, and related technologies.

I would be highly appreciated if you could leave your comments and thoughts on what I have written <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.

## Tech stack

This blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

A huge thanks to [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for the minimal, lightweight, and super easy-to-customize blog starter.

A few major over-engineering-changes from the original repo:

- <Twemoji emoji="atom-symbol" /> Upgrading to **React 18**, **Next 14** (Using App router).
- <Twemoji emoji="party-popper" /> Adopting **Typescript**, committing with [Conventional
  Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- <Twemoji emoji="bar-chart" /> Monitoring site with [Umami](https://umami.is/) website analytics.
- <Twemoji emoji="eyes" /> Theming in dark mode with [Github dark
  dimmed](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-14-dark-and-dimmed-themes-are-now-generally-available/)
  colors for better contrast.
- <Twemoji emoji="man-technologist" /> Making a lot of changes to the UI, new homepage design,
  adding `ProfileCard`, `CareerTimeline` components, adding `/friends`, `/snippets`,
  `/resume(coding...)` page, etc.
