Today is January 16, 2024, and tomorrow is the company's annual meeting. Finally, I have time to sit down and write a year-end summary.

In previous years, the end of the year was usually relatively free, with requirements frozen in advance, but this year has been exceptionally busy.

This year's Spring Festival legal holiday was extended to 8 days, and the company, as usual, gave an additional 3 days, plus a Sunday, making it a 12-day long holiday. I also took 4 days of annual leave before the festival, connecting with 2 days of weekend, ultimately extending the Spring Festival holiday to 18 days, setting my personal record for the longest holiday üëç.

Many colleagues also chose similar vacation arrangements, causing holidays like Valentine's Day to fall during the vacation period. Therefore, the development and testing of related activities had to be completed in advance, making the month before the holiday particularly busy.

Let's review some of the plans made last year.

## 2024 Annual Plan Review

- [x] 1. Travel abroad with my wife once

  Went to Japan in May this year. "[üáØüáµ Japan Trip](/blog/202405/Travels_In_Japan)"

- [ ] 2. ~~Take parents on a domestic trip once~~.

  Not completed.

- [ ] 3. ~~Drink more water, average 2000ml per day, normal uric acid.~~

  Not completed, average daily water intake **1905ml**.

- [x] 4. Exercise more, run more than 240 kilometers

  Completed, ran **246.22** kilometers.

- [ ] 5. ~~Continue weight loss, lose 10 pounds of fat, lose fatty liver.~~

  Not completed. Continued running this year, but weight loss effect was not obvious.

- [ ] 6. ~~Save xx thousand.~~

  Not completed.

- [x] 7. Learn English

  Basically completed, although there was no clear goal, I persisted in memorizing words during my commute to work. Progress was slow, and next year's plan is still to focus time on memorizing words. Looking back at my preparation for the graduate school entrance exam, I could memorize many words every day, but now it's been a year and I haven't finished reviewing what I memorized in a few months back then.

  **New Language Goal**: Started learning Japanese this year, mainly through Duolingo and Busuu, making a little progress every day, progress is slow, but will continue to persist.

# 2024 Year-End Summary

## 1. Career Achievements and Development

This is my third year joining the company, and the company's overall revenue has maintained rapid growth in the current environment, which is a rare good news.

Technically, I applied for and obtained a patent, which is a new milestone in my career development.

## 2. Personal Technical Growth

### Open Source Community

Officially became a co-builder of the well-known animation library **tween.js**. I hope to continue contributing to the open source community and let technology influence more people.

## 3. Health

### Exercise

Still maintained exercise this year, mainly running, increasing from **3km** per day last year to **5km** per day.

The goal set at the beginning of the year was 240km for the whole year, actually completed **246km** (6km not recorded), completed the goal, but slightly lower than last year.

This year's step count decreased by 50,000 compared to last year, but calorie consumption increased by **70,000**.

Average sleep time decreased from 6h52m last year to **6h39m**, which is not good.

![grow.webp](/static/images/blog/202501/2024_Year_Summary/grow.webp)

### Weight

The goal of losing 10 pounds set at the beginning of the year was not completed, and weight increased instead of decreasing. After starting exercise, weight briefly decreased, then gradually increased month by month, with an average weight increase of **2.58kg** compared to last year.

### Water Intake

The goal set at the beginning of the year was to drink 2000ml of water per day on average, this year's completion rate was 1905ml, plus the water intake not recorded during holidays at home, I believe it should have exceeded 2000ml. According to records, the daily average increased by 98ml compared to last year.

Water intake records this year mainly relied on Apple Watch's Grow, paired with watch face complications, making it very intuitive to see daily water intake completion and very convenient to record.
