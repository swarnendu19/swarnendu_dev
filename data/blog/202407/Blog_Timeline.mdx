Let me take this opportunity to introduce my self-built blog timeline.

## My Self-Built Blog Timeline

### CSDN

Proudly announcing: Blog visits have exceeded 1,000,000

I checked my registration date, which was **2014-07-10**, almost ten years ago. As for why I chose CSDN back then, it might have been to solve problems or out of curiosity.

As a必经之地 (must-visit place) for Chinese programmers, CSDN was undoubtedly my programming启蒙导师 (enlightenment mentor). Despite some搬运 (reposting) and varying quality content, it has indeed provided rich resources for the Chinese programming community. Even today, CSDN remains a良师益友 (good teacher and friend) for many computer science students.

> Later, I started building my own blog
